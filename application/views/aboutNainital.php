The ancient name of Naini Tal is Tri- Rishi Sarovar, after the three sages, Atri, Agastya and Pulaha. It is believed that they came here on a penitential pilgrimage while going to Mansarovar, the holy lake in Tibet. On finding no water here for drinking, they dug a large hole and siphoned water from Mansarovar with their divine powers. Thus the ancient Indians believed that a dip in the Naini Lake earned the same religious merit equal to a holy dip in the Mansarovar Lake. The second important religious reference to Naini Tal is as one of the 64 Shakti Peeths, i.e. centres of spiritual powers. These centres were created wherever parts of the body of Lord Shiva’s consort, Goddess Sati fell, when he was carrying her body in grief. It is said that the left eye, (Nain) of Sati fell here and this gave rise to the name of local goddess Naina and the lake as Naini Tal, the lake of goddess Naina. the whole valley of NainiTal was treated as a temple by the Indians and people entered the valley after bathing and removing their foot wear in respect. According to Professor K.S.Valdiya a pioneer in Himalayan geology, the Naini Lake was formed owing to faulting which uplifted the Naini-Sher-ka-Danda ridge with respect to the southern Ayarpatta block resulting into the blockade of an ancient river/stream meandering through the Khurpatal –Nainital valley.</p>
                <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The British occupied Kumaon and Garhwal in 1815. After the British occupation, Edward Gardener was appointed as the first Commissioner of Kumaon Division from 8th May 1815 to 13th April 1816 He was succeeded by George William Traill, who held this position up to   30th November 1835. Historians have mentioned that P. Barron discovered Nainital, it was not discovered but was already famous as a religious centre since ancient times. The whole valley of Nainital was treated as a temple by the Indians and people entered it after bathing and removing their foot wear in respect. George William Traill was the first European to have visited Nainital while conducting the revenue settlement of 1823, popularly known as ‘Assi Saala Bundobast’, as it was conducted in Samvat 1880 or 1823 AD. But he did not popularize his visit owing to the religious importance of the sacred place. He had great admiration for the traditions of the hill people and he did his best to hide the existence of Naini Tal. Barron who is credited to be the first European to come to Naini Tal in 1841 has himself mentioned in his book, ‘Wanderings in the Himmala’ that Traill was the first European to have visited Naini Tal. He says that Traill was very jealous of his discovery and did not want to reveal it to other Europeans. Actually it was Traill’s love for the Kumaoni culture and Kumaon that he did not want the aliens to enter this spiritual abode as they would defile the sanctity of this divine place. The credit of initiating urban development of Naini Tal goes to Commissioner of Kumaon, George Thomas Lushington (30th November 1838 to25th October 1848), P. Barron and Moti Ram Sah. By the end of 1843 the urbanisation of Naini Tal was well in advance and in 1847 according to the historical records, it had become popular as a health/tourist resort or sanatorium for the British. The first bungalow, which was constructed in Naini Tal according to a survey of Captain Waugh of 1845, was of Major Arnaud. He was leased 280 acres of land in Gaiwala Khet (cow’s field) or Gwali Khet, Raj Bhawan area where arguably he constructed the bungalow, Sherwood House in 1843. Barron was also given three leases 32, 9 and 3 acres of land respectively.  Moti Ram Sah from Almora took a leading part in the settlement of Naini Tal both as a contractor and by advancing loans to British officers. On 3rd October 1850, the Naini Tal Municipal Board was formally constituted. It was the second Municipal Board of the North Western Provinces and its Bye Laws, which were finally approved in July 1851 were one of the best in the country. Mohan Lal Sah the freedom fighter and banker, was elected as its first Indian Chairman in 1935-36 and Sheikh Abdul Kayyum as its senior Vice Chairman.  In October 1855 the Commissioner’s office was transferred from Almora to Naini Tal owing to its proximity to the plains. The credit of establishing the Commissioner’s office goes to Henry Ramsay though his predecessor, John Hallet Batten had already purchased and repaired Ousley Grove for the Commissioner’s office and Kutcherry in Naini Tal.</p>
                <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The hill town assumed a great importance after 1857 as there was no outbreak of disorder here and served as a safe hide out for the refugees from the neighbouring plains. Moti Ram Sah played an important in helping the British financially and providing valuable intelligence to the British. In 1862 Nainital was made the summer seat of the North Western Provinces and a great educational centre for British children. Mission School where the present CRST Intermediate College is located is the oldest educational institution in Naini Tal, established in 1850. In 1928 an educationist, Chetram Sah Thulgharia purchased the school in fifty thousand rupees and it came to be known as CRST after his name.  Concomitantly Sherwood College (1867), All Saints’ College (1869) and St. Mary’s Convent (1878) came into existence. Subsequently the Philanders Smith College now known as Birla Vidya Mandir was established. It was the result of the amalgamation of Philanders Smith College transferred from Mussorie to Nainital in 1905 and the Oak Openings Boys’ High School, already established in Nainital in 1877. Wellesley Girls High School was started in 1882. After Independence this premier institution was purchased by the philanthropist, Th. Dan Singh Bisht. Concomitantly he donated the building and five lakh rupees with about 12 acres of land to the government for starting a degree college in Nainital. The poor students from the towns and villages of Uttarakhand found it difficult to go to Allahabad or Lucknow for higher education and thus he rendered a yeoman service in the field of higher education. Today the academic block of Kumaon University is housed there.   Later he donated the estate Smuggler’s Rock where the girl’s hostels of the university are sited. </p>
                <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Gradually Nainital also became an important centre of trade and banking facilities were provided. In the 1880s the Bank of Upper India was established. Later in 1916 it was known as the Alliance Bank of Shimla and in 1923 as the Imperial Bank of India.  In 1955 it was renamed as the State Bank of India. After the establishment of the Bank of Upper India, the Allahabad Bank was established in 1892. In 1922 the Naini Tal Bank came into existence and the Durga Lal Sah Mohan Lal Sah Bank was established by Mohan Lal Sah, the famous freedom fighter in Ranikhet in 1928. The same year his name was included in the list of the eminent bankers of India. In 1932 its branch was established in Almora and in 1935 in Naini Tal. Today it is known as Kurmachal Nagar Sahkari Bank Ltd and has made great progress under the dynamic leadership of its former president, late Madan Lal Sah and can boast of 41 branches currently. The importance of the town was further boosted with the installation of the rail link to Kathgodam from Bareilly on 24th October 1884 and with the formation of the Naini Tal district in 1891; water supply scheme was completed in Naini Tal in 1899. The Talli Tal Post Office came into existence in 1896 and the Malli Tal Post Office in 1903. In 1911-12 Naini Tal was amongst a few privileged cities of the country where telephone services were available.</p>
                <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> In 1905, Naini Tal became the Headquarters of the Eastern Command and in 1908 the summer laboratory of Chemical Examiner was established in the Stone Leigh compound. In 1913 it was upgraded to Senior Chemical Examiner Laboratory. Later it was shifted to Karachi and finally to Poona as High Energy Material Laboratory. The completion of a motor road between Kathgodam and Naini Tal in 1915 further contributed to the growth of the town. The first printing press, King Press was established in Naini Tal in 1919. In 1922, the electrification scheme was initiated for the town of Naini Tal.</p>
                <p align="justify">After Independence Naini Tal came in the international map and also the Naini Tal district, which was constituted in 1891 as mentioned earlier. In October 1995 Udham Singh Nagar was carved out of Naini Tal district and was named after Shaeed –i-Azam, Udham Singh a great revolutionary. The head quarter of the district is Rudrapur, which was established in the medieval period by Raja Rudra Chand. He was an illustrious ruler of Chand dynasty, which ruled Kumaon. In 1960 the Uttar Pradesh Government decided not to shift the capital to Naini Tal during summers, and in the initial stages this proved a great set back to the economy of the town and district. But it limped back to normalcy and was soon revived as a tourist resort by 1972. With the formation of the State, tourism has been given a big fillip though it has disturbed the ecology and tranquility of the Naini Tal and the administration is trying to combat the situation with great vigour. </p>
